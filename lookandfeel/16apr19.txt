* use the features.html as a template to work the look and feel page1.
  make it as responsive as possible.
* work on general stuff now, animations comes later
* proof of concept for animation:
	- the matrix brackets stay intact
	- 1 goes to 0, 0 to 1 and so on in counter clockwise
	- strategy includes making this into a complete css
	  design so that, it can be animated at will
